## Central Limit Theorem

```{python}
from symbulate import *
#'exec(%matplotlib inline)' 
import matplotlib

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```{python}
# clear the plot space:
plt.clf()
# Define the probability type of function as uniform (probability space)
P = Uniform(0,40)
# Define X as a random variable of the type P (uniform)
X =RV(P)
# Simulate the values of X and save the in the x array: 
x=X.sim(10000)
x.plot()
plt.show()
```

I generate a matrix of 25 columns with 10,000 rows with random \# following the same uniform distribution:

```{python}
# Define the probability space as a vector of 25 uniform random numbers:
P = Uniform(0,40) ** 25
# Define XVECTOR as a vector of random variables with 25 random values 
XVECTOR =RV(P)
# Simulate 10,000 vectors to get a matrix  
xmatrix=XVECTOR.sim(10000)
```

Now I get the mean of the 10,000 means; 1 for each variable:

```{python}
# The 2nd parameter is the mathematical operation applied to each row of the random vector
# Simulate 10,000 means of each random vector of 25 uniform distributed numbers: 
xmean = RV(P,mean).sim(10000)
xmean
```
